# üìö Function Call Prompt Collection (for MCP Server Integration)

This repository contains a curated collection of **natural language prompts** designed to trigger OpenAI Function Calls. Each prompt corresponds to a specific backend function and is intended to work seamlessly with an MCP Server.

Each prompt is written in Markdown and organized by third-party services such as **Aliyun**, **Amap**, **GitHub**, **Google Maps**, and **Grafana**.
